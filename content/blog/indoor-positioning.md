At LOCUS we are bringing online-inspired customer analytics to brick and mortar stores using Internet of Things and Artifiial Intelligence.

When a customer browses through an on-line store, every single click is recorder and analyzed. This data is then used to imrpove customer experience and drive sales. In a physical store the only available data is the receipt and points cards. How the customer arrived at the purchase is a mystery.
